Discription:

As part of the course, Product Life Cycle Management (PLM), under the supervision of professor Salehi, our team had to develop a humanoid robot hand.
The hand works with two separate microcontrollers, one on the robot hand and the other on the glove. The communication takes place via Bluetooth.  The sensor in the glove is a flexible resistor that increases resistance with increased angle. In this way the fingers of the robot hand can be controlled.


The electronic components are the following:

ARM Cortex-M3 Microcontroller (NXP LPC1769)

HiTec HS-485 HB

Spectra Symbol Flex Sensor SEN-08606

Rayson BTM-222 Bluetooth Modul
